        "In this section of the homework, we were required to create a new function to evaluate the similarity score. We chose to use a type of similarity called Jaccard Similarity, which is quite similar to Cosine Similarity and can assess the resemblance between two texts. The focus of the investigation was on analyzing a query that assumed a student's search for a full-time master's program in Management starting in October. To achieve this, we initially created a function to calculate the score for each analyzed course, placing greater emphasis on the similarity in course names, which adds an additional 0.2 to the score. This is because, when searching for courses of study, the name (what is studied) carries greater importance for achieving an optimal result.\n",

              "324    We live in a changing world. As developments in Big Data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things transform the careers of the future, the world must develop concurrent principles for the ethical use of such technologies. In fields as varied as digital commerce, warfare and humanitarianism, comprehensive legal frameworks protect individuals’ rights to data privacy – often backed up by technical solutions. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has established a new normal of data privacy regulation for companies and organizations across the world.The IAPP has estimatedthat as many as 75,000 data protection officers needed to be appointed globally in response to the GDPR. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the need for data protection into even sharper relief.   \n",
